As I entered the gurudwara sahib , I suddenly realised that my new journey has begun .

__As fishermen need boat â›µ to reach their destination , thisGurudwara is not less than a<mark>**ship**</mark> that will take me to my destination_
as the shape of the gurudwara sahib is similar to a ship 

Starting from kirtan,from reciting  JAPJI SAHIB to CHUPAI SAHIB I got soo immersed in the devotion of Guru Sahib that I Didn't realised that I am in the Jahaz of Waheguru and had travelled in the ship for one hour
